### Hi there! Welcome to my projects. A little bit about me:

- 💡 I'm currently a data scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Medicine. 
- 📚 I'm an interdisciplinary thinker with a B.A. in East Asian Studies from Middlebury College, and an M.A. Southeast Asian History from UW-Madison.
- 👯‍♀️ I'd love to collaborate on social justice, political and economic development related projects!
- 🌄 In my free time, I like trying out new recipes, reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, and watching anime. (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, anyone?)
- 😊 My pronouns are she/her.
- 🌍 Fun fact: I grew up in Myanmar, but have spent the majority of my adult life in the US.
